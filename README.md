PT Tracker

This web application allows a personal fitness trainer to track the progress of their clients, and also track training sessions and packages. It also allows the client to log in and track their progress and sessions.

Version .9
This version allows users to register/sign-in and go to their personal dashboard. They can see number of sessions used/left in training package, and their weekly statistics (measurements).

A trainer can view all of their clients and select one to work with. They can also track the items above and enter in new statistics, training sessions, and package information for the client.

History pages are available for both training sessions and statistics.
